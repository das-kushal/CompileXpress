 # Compile*X*press

#### This is CompileXpress which allows anyone to write some code and execute it and get the result <br>
$\textcolor{red}{\textsf{I have attached a demo video at the end.}}$

#### In this app you will get
  - Editor to write your code
  - Small terminal to see the output
  - Light and dark theme changer
  - settings to change the fontsize, tabSpace, font Family and word wrap
  - Also you can change language , presently only 3 languages are supported - C++, Python, Javascript
  - You can also set the default language and it is persistent even if you refresh the page
  - Suppose we write some code in C++ and then we change the language to Python and come back to C++ again then the previously written code stays

- For frontend React is used which is built using Vite which is super fast and also supports hot reloading
- For backend I created an express server
- The server uses exec to run the code in the terminal and produces the results which are then displyed in the frontend
